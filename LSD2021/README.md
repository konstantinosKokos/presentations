# LSD 2021

A short demo presentation for Language Sciences Day 2021 in UU.

To run this at home you will need a couple of things:

1. a clean virtual environment with python>3.9
2. a clone of [neural-proof-nets](https://github.com/konstantinosKokos/neural-proof-nets)
   (you will only need the `Parser` directory and `requirements.txt`)
3. a local copy of the Parser's weights (please refer to the instructions in the above link)
4. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download dependencies
5. a local copy of [LassySmall](https://taalmaterialen.ivdnt.org/download/tstc-lassy-klein-corpus/)


After the above, your working dir should look like
```
 |---- LSD\ 2021.ipynb
 |---- README.md
 |---- requirements.txt
 |---- Parser/
 |---- stored_models/
       |---- model_weights.model
```
